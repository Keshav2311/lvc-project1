    <h1>MERN STACK</h1>
    <p>
    The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications. The acronym MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Here's a brief overview of each component: <br><br>

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's known for its scalability and ease of use, making it a great choice for modern web applications. <br><br>

2. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, making server-side development more efficient. <br><br>

3. React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. React allows developers to create reusable UI components. <br><br>

4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance applications. <br><br>

The MERN stack is favored for several reasons:

- Single Language: Since all components use JavaScript, developers can work across the entire stack without needing to switch languages.
- Efficiency: The stack is designed to handle JSON data natively, which streamlines data flow between the front-end and back-end.
- Community Support: Each technology in the MERN stack has a large, active community, providing plenty of resources and support for developers.
