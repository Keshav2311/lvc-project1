        <h1>MEAN STACK</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
    The MEAN stack is a popular technology stack used for building dynamic web applications. The acronym MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Here's a brief overview of each component: <br><br>

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's designed for scalability and ease of use, making it ideal for modern web applications. <br><br>

2. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust web applications and APIs. It handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests efficiently. <br><br>

3. Angular: A front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a rich set of tools and features for creating interactive user interfaces. <br><br>

4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance applications. <br><br>

The MEAN stack is favored for several reasons:

- Single Language: All components use JavaScript, allowing developers to work across the entire stack without switching languages.
- Efficiency: The stack is designed to handle JSON data natively, streamlining data flow between the front-end and back-end.
- Community Support: Each technology in the MEAN stack has a large, active community, providing plenty of resources and support for developers.
