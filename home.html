                <p>Live virtual classes are an innovative way to deliver education and training through the internet. They offer a real-time, interactive learning experience that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. <br>
                    Benefits: <br><br>
                    I. Real-Time Interaction: Students and teachers can communicate through video, audio, and chat, allowing for immediate feedback and engagement. <br><br>
                    II. Flexibility: Participants can join from any location, making it accessible for those who cannot attend in person. <br><br>
                    III. Interactive Tools: Many platforms offer features like screen sharing, virtual whiteboards, and breakout rooms to enhance learning. <br><br>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p> IV. Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for travel and physical infrastructure, often making it a more affordable option for both institutions and students. <br><br>
                    V. Resource Accessibility: Instructors can share digital resources, such as slides, videos, and documents, instantly with students. <br><br>
                    VI. Recorded Sessions: Many LVC platforms allow sessions to be recorded, so students can review the material later if they miss a class or need to revisit the content. <br><br>
                    LVCs have become increasingly popular, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as they offer a viable alternative to traditional classroom settings.
