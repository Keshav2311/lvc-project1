        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Here are some key points about AI: <br><br>

        1. Types of AI:
           - Narrow AI: Designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition or image classification. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. <br>
           - General AI: A theoretical form of AI that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. <br>
           - Superintelligent AI: An advanced form of AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. This is currently a topic of speculation and research. <br>    
        2. Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions based on data. ML is used in various applications, such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles. <br>
